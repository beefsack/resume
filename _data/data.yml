projects:
    title: Projects
    intro: >
      While my professional career has focused on PHP / TypeScript web
      development, my true passion is in Rust, Go and Kubernetes. This is
      reflected in the majority of my side projects.
    assignments:
      - title: brdg.me
        link: https://github.com/brdgme/brdgme
        tagline: |
          An ascii art board gaming platform, with a focus on text interfaces.
          The current iteration of the application is a mixture of Rust and Go,
          and runs in Kubernetes on Linode.

          The vision for the service is to support pure play-by-email, in that
          player moves are made by replying with a command to the email itself
          and not needing to use a web interface. There is a custom SMTP server
          I have implemented to handle command input.

          The first iteration of brdg.me was entirely in Go and was roughly 50k
          LOC. As my interest in Rust grew, I began doing new game
          implementations in Rust, as game implementations are language
          agnostic.
